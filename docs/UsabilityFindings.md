# Usability Testing Findings
**Participants**: 2 Ops Managers, 2 Finance Directors, 1 Growth Lead.

## Top Wins (What Worked)
1.  **Scenario Sliders**: Users loved the tactile feel of specific levers. *"Finally, I can see what happens if I just tweak this one thing."*
2.  **"What We Don't Know" Section**: Rated highest for building trust. *"Most tools try to sound too smart. I like that this admits when it's just guessing."*
3.  **Decision Memo Format**: The BLUF structure saved them from rewriting the output.

## Friction Points (Needs Fix)
1.  **"Smart Questions" Context**: Users wanted to know *why* a question was ranked #1.
    *   *Fix*: Added a "Why this?" tooltip to the Smart Question cards.
2.  **Confidence Score Confusion**: Users interpreted "85% Confidence" as "85% Success Rate".
    *   *Fix*: Renamed to "Data Reliability Score" to clarify it's about the input quality, not the business outcome.
3.  **Export Options**: Users demanded PowerPoint export, not just PDF.
    *   *Fix*: Added to V1 roadmap.

## Design Iterations
*   **Before**: "Run Simulation" button was small.
*   **After**: Changed to a full-width Primary Action button with a "calculating" animation to show work is being done.

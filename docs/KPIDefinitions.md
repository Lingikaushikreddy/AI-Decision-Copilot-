# KPI & Metrics Definitions

## Finance Metrics
### 1. Contribution Margin 2 (CM2)
*   **Definition**: `Net Revenue - COGS - Variable Logistics - Variable Marketing`.
*   **Why it matters**: True measure of unit economics before fixed overhead.
*   **Gotchas**: Often confused with Gross Margin. Ensure logistics costs are included.

### 2. Variance %
*   **Definition**: `(Actual - Budget) / Budget`.
*   **Logic**:
    *   Positive (+) in Revenue = Good.
    *   Positive (+) in Expense = Bad.
    *   *System must distinguish directionality based on account type.*

## Operations Metrics
### 3. OTIF (On-Time In-Full)
*   **Definition**: `% of orders delivered to the customer by calculation: (Total On-Time & Complete Orders / Total Orders)`.
*   **Threshold**: World-class is >98%. Warning trigger at <95%.
*   **Gotcha**: "On-Time" is defined by the *Customer's Requested Date*, not our Ship Date.

### 4. Inventory Turnover
*   **Definition**: `COGS / Average Inventory Value`.
*   **Target**: High is good (efficient). Low means stale cash.

## Growth Metrics
### 5. LTV (Lifetime Value) - 3 Year Cap
*   **Definition**: `Avg Order Value * Purchase Frequency * Gross Margin * (1 / Churn Rate)`.
*   **Constraint**: Cap LTV calculation at 3 years max for conservative planning. Do not use "infinite" LTV.

### 6. CAC Payback Period
*   **Definition**: `CAC / (Monthly Gross Profit per Customer)`.
*   **Target**: < 12 months for SMB, < 18 months for Enterprise.

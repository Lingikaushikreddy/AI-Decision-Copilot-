# Decision Playbook: Executive Logic & Trade-offs

## Core Philosophy: What is a "Good Decision"?
A good decision isn't just "profitable"; it balances **Efficiency (Speed)**, **Economics (ROI)**, and **Risk (Compliance/Brand)**.

*   **Bad Decision**: "Cut marketing spend by 50% to hit Q4 profit targets." (Ignores long-term pipeline damage).
*   **Good Decision**: "Reallocate 20% of worst-performing programmatic ad spend into organic content, accepting a 1-month lead time tax for higher LTV."

## Validated Questions & Levers

### Use Case 1: Capital Allocation (Finance)
**The "Must-Ask" Questions (Context):**
1.  "Is this variance truly one-off (e.g., severance pay) or structural (e.g., vendor price hike)?"
2.  "What is the *committed* spend vs. *actual* spend? Can we claw back the variance?"
3.  "Does this impact our debt covenants (EBITDA thresholds)?"

**Real Levers (What Managers Control):**
*   **Headcount Freeze**: Delay hiring start dates.
*   **Vendor Terms**: Negotiate Net-60 vs Net-30 payment terms (Cash flow impact).
*   **T&E Caps**: Reduce travel budgets.

**Avoid "Dumb" Questions:**
*   "Why is revenue down?" (Too vague. Ask: "Which product line drove the 5% revenue miss?")

### Use Case 2: Inventory Optimization (Ops)
**The "Must-Ask" Questions:**
1.  "Is the excess stock perishable or seasonal?"
2.  "What is the cost of transfer vs. cost of markdown?" (Freight > Margin loss?)
3.  "Does the destination warehouse have the labor capacity to receive this influx?"

**Real Levers:**
*   **markdowns**: Drop price to clear shelf space.
*   **Transfers**: Move stock to high-demand region (incurs shipping cost).
*   **Donations/Write-offs**: Tax benefit vs. total loss.

### Use Case 3: Market Expansion (Growth)
**The "Must-Ask" Questions:**
1.  "What is the payback period for this new channel?"
2.  "Do we have a localized sales rep in that region yet?"
3.  "Is the CAC sustainable at scale, or just for early adopters?"

**Real Levers:**
*   **Bid Caps**: Limit max spend per click.
*   **Channel Mix**: Shift budget from FB to LinkedIn.
*   **Geo-Targeting**: Exclude expensive/low-converting zip codes.

## Explanation Style Guide ("Exec-Ready")
*   **BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)**: Start with the recommendation, then the "Why".
*   **No Fluff**: Avoid "It seems like..." or "Maybe...". Use "Data suggests..."
*   **Quantify Risks**: "High Risk (70% probability of impacting Q4 roadmap)".
